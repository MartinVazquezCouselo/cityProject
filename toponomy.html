    <p>California is the name that Spanish conquerors assigned to an area of ​​America corresponding to the peninsula that today bears the same name and to a region located north of it. This denomination comes from an imaginary place mentioned in Las sergas de Esplandián, a novel of chivalry by Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, published in 1510. It is still disputed where exactly the idea of ​​using such a name came from, to what was initially believed to be a island and was called California.
        During the 18th century, the Spanish Crown divided it administratively between Alta or Nueva California, and Baja or Vieja California. The first extended to the northwest of the Viceroyalty of New Spain (today California, Nevada, Arizona and Utah, in the USA); while the second corresponded to the peninsula, that is, to the current Mexican states of Baja California and Baja California Sur. For that reason the sources of the time referred to the region as: Las Californias, which was in common use until the territorial cession to the United States, as a result of the invasion of Mexico in 1848.</p>
